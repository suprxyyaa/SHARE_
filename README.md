# SHARE — Healthcare Platform

A full-stack healthcare appointment and medical file sharing platform.
Patients book doctors, manage private medical records, and share files securely.
Doctors get verified before going live. Admins manage verifications.

---

## What it does

- Patients search and book verified doctors
- Patients upload medical records privately (stored on Cloudinary)
- Patients share files with a specific doctor with an expiry date
- Patients can revoke file access at any time
- Doctors register with a medical certificate and wait for admin approval
- Doctors manage availability and confirm/cancel appointments
- Video appointments get a Jitsi meeting link automatically
- Admin approves/rejects doctors and views platform reports
- Every file access attempt is permanently audit logged
- Single `authorize()` function enforces all file access — no exceptions

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medshare.git
cd /d/medshare
```

### 2. Create backend environment file

Create `backend/.env` with these values:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_YeUCqAh1uK2x@ep-divine-hall-a1rhub5f-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require

## Security Design

The file access system is built around a single invariant enforced in `authorize()`:

> A file can only be accessed if a valid, non-expired, non-revoked permission exists — and every access attempt is permanently logged.

- `authorize()` is the **only** place that checks file permissions
- Every access attempt writes to `audit_log` in the same transaction
- Revocation is immediate and permanent — cannot be undone
- Files are private by default — sharing requires explicit patient action

---

## Database

Hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech) — cloud PostgreSQL, free tier.
No local database setup needed. Tables are already created.

**10 tables:**
`tenant` `user` `doctor_profile` `patient_profile` `availability`
`appointment` `medical_file` `file_permission` `audit_log` `review`

---

## File Storage

Files stored on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) — free tier (25GB).
Medical files go to `medshare/patients/{patient_id}/`
Doctor certificates go to `medshare/certificates/`
